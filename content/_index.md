title: "Thousand Furrows Farm"
subtitle: "A small, diversified veggie farm in Warren Oregon"
description : >
  In 2023, the farm moved from Troutdale to it's long-term home in Warren Oregon. As a result of this move, the farm is transitioning to low- and no-till farming methods. I am excited to see how this change benefits crop quality, weed control, labor management and water retention.
  The farm markets its veggies through the St. Johns Farmers Market, the Clatskanie Food Hub and custom orders for on-farm pickup. If you are interested in purchasing veggies, send me an email!
